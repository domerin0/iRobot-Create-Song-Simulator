# iRobot-Create-Song-Simulator
Simulates songs on your computer for the create.

This project is meant to simulate musical songs played by the iRobot Create, so you can hear your creations before putting them on the
robot.
**Note** Songs will not sound exactly as they will on the create, C# doesn't do fractional frequencies (ex/ 54.7), and instead all
fractional frequencies were rounded to the nearest integer, using the even midpoint rounding rule.
Examples for usage is coming soon.
